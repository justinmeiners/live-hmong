# Live Hmong

Live Hmong is a small collection of basic vocabulary words for beginners.
Most Hmong vocabulary resources are organized like dictionaries, and try to cover a wide list of words. This approach is overwhelming, and unnecessary for most beginners.
Live Hmong is unique in that organizes words around real life contexts to give beginners a grasp of everyday language.
 It also focuses on mostly single symbol words, which are the building blocks and intuition for all words on Hmong.

I created this guide, with help from my teacher Ku Moua, to help me while I was studying Hmong.
I am by no means a language expert so the book likely contains mistakes. If you have any suggestions or contributions feel free to contact me.
